# nflverseraw

This repo hosts an internal nflverse package. It provides some helper functions 
to download raw pbp data using a nflverse internal package and 
releases them into nflverse releases. 

nflfastR uses these raw pbp to create the nflfastR pbp dataset. 

Code in `/auto/` runs automatically in a gh action.
