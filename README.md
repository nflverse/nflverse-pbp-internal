# nflverseraw

This repo hosts an internal nflverse package. It provides some helper functions 
to download raw pbp data from the nflapi using the nflverse internal nflapi
package and releases them into nflverse releases. 

nflfastR uses these raw pbp to create the nflfastR pbp dataset. 

Code in `/auto/` runs automatically in a gh actuion.
